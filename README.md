# Overview

This mobile application is a simple and intuitive Task Tracker built to help users stay organized and manage their daily to-dos. The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of mobile app development and modern Android architecture while gaining practical experience with Jetpack Compose, state management, navigation, and persistent local storage.
The app allows users to:

- Add new tasks  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Edit task titles  
- Delete tasks  
- Persist all task data even after the app is closed (using **Proto DataStore**)

Using the app is straightforward—open it, tap the “Add Task” button, enter a title, and your new task appears in the list. Tapping on an existing task opens the edit screen, where you can modify or delete it. Checkboxes allow you to toggle task completion instantly.

This project strengthens my understanding of Android UI development, data flow, and local persistence—skills that will be essential as I continue building more advanced applications.
